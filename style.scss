This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.

 ltbPhotography is based on Underscores http://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2013 Automattic, Inc.

Resetting and rebuilding styles have been helped along thanks to the fine work of
Eric Meyer http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/index.html
along with Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/
and Blueprint http://www.blueprintcss.org/

Does this look like robot-barf to you? This stylesheet was assembled using SASS <sass-lang.com>.
Those files are much more readable and available at my github <github.com/reverendgeneral>.
